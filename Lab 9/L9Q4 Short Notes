Create a Dice game. 

The first dice game allows the player to roll two dices each time. 
If both dice is equal, the player can roll again. 
The player score each time they roll the dices. 
Player that reaches 100 points or more wins the game. 

The second dice game allows the player to roll one dice each time. 
When the dice is 6, the player can roll one more time. 
However, if the player rolls 6 again in second attempt, the player wonâ€™t have any score. 
Player that reaches 100 point wins the game. 
If the player scores more than 100, the last score is not counted and the player needs to roll again in next turn. 

Create a Tester class to test the program

====================================================
1. Create 
class DiceGame{
instance var: Player player1,  player2; int round; //access modifier: Private
constructor for player1 & player 2
start() method
isWin() method

2. abstract class Player{
instance var : score, name
Player()
Player(String a)
display()
getScore()
setScore(int score)
getName()
setName(String name)
roll();

3. class PlayerGame1 extends Player{
instance var: dice1, dice2, Random
PlayerGame1(String a)
roll(){ roll 2, if same, roll again }

4. class PlayerGame2 extends Player
instance var: dice1, Random
PlayerGame2 (String a)
roll() { roll 1, if is 6 roll again and plus score, if 6 again score not count;}

5. class Tester{
PlayerGame1 player1 = new PlayerGame1("name"); //Create object
- repeat for player2 -
DiceGame game1 = new DiceGame(player1, player2);
game1.start();
- repeat for player3 & player4 for game2 -
