  //5. Write the java statements that determine whether the Leap year. A Leap year is divisible by 4 but not by 100. However, a Leap year is also divisible by 400.

import java.util.*;

public class T3Q1 {
    public static void main(String[] args){;
      
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Test if your favourite year is a leap year: ");
        int year = input.nextInt();

        if(year % 4 == 0 || year % 400 ==0){
            System.out.println("AHA Year "+year+" is a leap year!");
        }else{
            System.out.println("Not a leap year.");
        }
    }

}
